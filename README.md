## GOAL:
Given historical data on loans given out with information on whether or not the borrower defaulted (charge-off), 
can we build a model that can predict whether or nor a borrower will pay back their loan? This way in the future when we get a new potential 
customer we can assess whether or not they are likely to pay back the loan.
